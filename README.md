# Password Generator

## Description

Creating a new password, in any sense, can become quite the task. Thankfully, we have a solution! This webpage is designed to generate a random password through a few "yes" or "no" prompt style questions, leaving the stress of creating a new one in the past.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To Begin: *Click* the "Generate Password" button, and a prompt will appear at the top of the webpage.

The first prompt will ask the desired character length, for the new password to be created. Following, each prompt after will ask the user whether or not they would like certain criteria for their password, such as special characters, lowercase and uppercase characters, and lastly numbers. Answering "OK" accepts prompt criteria, while answering "Cancel" excludes the current prompt criteria. After finishing the last prompt, a new password with the users chosen criteria will generate in the text box above the "Generate Password" buton.
